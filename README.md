Added raw SVG code to index and modified CSS in SVG. Changed colours for hover, made finer details appear upon scaling up WOWie.

Deleted inline SVG code, replaced with object tag. Modified SVG source code. Added responsive design.
Fixed problem where details weren't showing when scaled upwards. Size for (min-width:) too big; Size does not describe width of page, but the width of the SVG itself.
